            //! \brief Liability account
            //!
            //! This account type records all of your company’s liabilities (the
            //! company’s debts). Whenever your company incurs more debt, these
            //! accounts are credited to increase liabilities. If your company
            //! makes a payment toward its debt, the liability account is debited.
            //!
            //! The following are examples of liability accounts:
            //!
            //! - Accounts payable
            //! - Notes payable
            //! - Accrued expenses

            //! You can calculate the equity of your company by subtracting the company’s
            //! liabilities from its assets.
            //!
            //! Examples:
            //!
            //! - Common stock
            //! - Retained earnings
            //! - Treasury stock

            //! Revenue refers to the assets that your company has earned through its
            //! business activities, such as revenue earned by delivering a service. For
            //! example, if you own a plumbing company and have delivered a plumbing
            //! service to a customer, the service revenue account will be credited
            //! since revenue accounts increase on the credit side.
            //!
            //! Examples:
            //!
            //! - Sales
            //! - Service fee revenues
