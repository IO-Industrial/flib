            //! \brief Pay Period enumeration
            //!
            //! A pay period is a recurring length of time over which employee time
            //! is recorded and paid. Examples of pay periods are weekly, bi-weekly,
            //! semi-monthly, and monthly.
            //!
            //! \note Some years have an extra pay period for some employees. This is called
            //! a "pay period leap year." This phenomenon only affects salaried
            //! employees who are paid on a bi-weekly basis. Depending on when the
            //! last pay period falls in the year, it's possible to have a 27th pay
            //! period in the year. If you can catch the issue early enough, you can
            //! divide the employee's annual salary by 27, instead of 26. If you can't
            //! catch it in time, you'll have to make some adjustments.
            //!
            //! \note Federal and state laws also come into play when determining pay periods.
            //! Although the IRS does not regulate the frequency of pay periods, some states
            //! do.
            //!
            //! Prorating Salary (Exempt employees)
            //!
            //! - If an employee starts work in the middle of a pay period, after working a week in the hole or more,
            //!   count the actual number of days worked to calculate prorated salary. Take the amount from dividing
            //!   the yearly salary by the number of pay periods, and divide it by the number of working days in the
            //!   pay period. The result is the daily rate. Multiply the daily rate by the number of days worked to finish
            //!   calculating the first paycheck. For example, a new employee with an annual salary of $50,000, paid
            //!   bi-weekly in a non-leap year, works four days. $50,000 is divided by 26 and the result is divided
            //!   by 10 (the number of working days in the pay period) to get the daily rate of $192.31. The daily rate
            //!   is multiplied by 4 and the gross pay is $769.24.
            //!
            //! - You may prorate a terminated exempt employee's pay if she does not work the entire pay period.

                //! of days from the payment period to the latest of:

                //! A weekly pay period results in 52 paychecks in a year. Hourly employees
                //! are often paid weekly. Sometimes these employees are paid a week in arrears.
                //! That is, they record and turn in their time sheets at the end of one week and
                //! are paid for that time a week later. This gives the payroll clerk time to

                //! Employees receive 26 paychecks per year. Because bi-weekly pay periods occur
                //! once every two weeks, some months will have three pay periods. To further
                //! complicate matters, every decade or so the extra day from leap years wreaks bi-weekly

                //! \note In some years, a bi-weekly payroll system might result in an additional
