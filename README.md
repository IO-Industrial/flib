# Common Types

This header-only repository contains common types, structures, equates, defines and 
specialized template functions.

To put it bluntly, this repository contains code that other code depends on so it 
isn't a stand alone repository.  We are slowly refactoring and moving code into
this repository. Use at your own risk.
